# Ensemble-Learning-Model-for-Cyber-Attack-Detection
A training dataset is preprocessed using feature mapping, feature normalisation, the correlation coefficient approach to discover optimum features, and replacing missing values with the mean of that specific feature. Then, to train the three ML algorithms—Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest—we employ ten cross-fold validation. A predictive model is created using the acquired prediction outputs. The system administrator will be notified if the inbound traffic exhibits any harmful activity, but otherwise, the request will be fulfilled.# Cyber-Attack-Detection-Model
